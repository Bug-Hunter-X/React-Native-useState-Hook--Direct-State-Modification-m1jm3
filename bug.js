This error occurs when using the useState hook in React Native and trying to update a state value with a function that modifies the state directly, instead of using the setter function provided by useState. For example, consider the following code:

```javascript
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const incrementCount = () => {
    count = count + 1; // Incorrect way to update state
  };

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>{count}</Text>
      <Button title="Increment" onPress={incrementCount} />
    </View>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

This will cause the React Native application to not re-render and the count value to not be updated in the UI. The correct way to update the state is to always use the setter function provided by useState, like this:

```javascript
const incrementCount = () => {
  setCount(count + 1); // Correct way to update state
};
```
